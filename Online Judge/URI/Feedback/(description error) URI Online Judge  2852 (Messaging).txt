Hi there!!!!
In the problem description of "URI Online Judge | 2852 (Messaging)" below the image in 2nd paragraph,
("
The text to be ciphered is "computer science";
The key-word is "obi";
Now, we should repeat the keyword many times as necessary to compose all the text to be ciphered:
    "computer science"
    "obiobiob obiobio"
")
In the last two lines the key sequence after the reputation of the key will be 
    "computer science"
    "obiobiob iobiobi"  <-- the last word "iobiobi"
correct --> "iobiobi" output --> "aqjmbdm" (in the 16th line before the 3rd paragraph).
wrong -->   "obiobio" output --> "gdqsoks"  (according to the wrong sequence).

Here is the code link that I submitted and got accepted: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/bHN4RxK9mB/

Thanks!!!
